## Chart and a Quote
### Welcome

- Project bootstrapped with Create React App
- Charts created with ReCharts
- Single Table with React Bootstrap Table
- WikiQuote scraping done with the help of wikiquotes-api module
- Otherwise, React, World Health Organisation JSON, lots of raw CSS (with much help from Stack Overflow), raw JavaScript functionality, and passion went into this creation.

Hope it gives you a few moments of enjoyment, and something worth remembering.
