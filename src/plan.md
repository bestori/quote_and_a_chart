# React Poetry App:

1. First, I need to clean up my code as in it is a mess, I need to go through it and make it look good, well thought out

2. Then I move onto actual implementation

    1. First, decide what datasets to use

        1. What are you to say during each line

        2. Write the poem before writing any code

        3. Conceptualise how the data will be represented

            1. tiny line chart for a data that is obvious and obscure to think about

            2. definitely use line charts with reference lines

                1. …possibly the dot line charts

                2. label looks about right

            3. bar charts
                1. custom shape has personality

            4. area chart can be used to express financial aspects

        4. two level bar chart can conceptualise data in numbers when comparing world at large

        5. simple radial bar chart can do comparisons based upon age


1. Keypress to open next table or chart

2. Find a way to have the navbar solely there when a user puts mouse at top of screen, never at any other time

3. alcohol deaths chart needs multiple fixes,
    1. there should not be countries listed multiple times(so, solely Both sexes).

    2. The highest number should come up when user clicks the carrot.

    3. Should it solely be the one year or multiple years averaged?
4. Open defecation can be used as well as… child mortality


3 charts atm, need at least 7 more, it has to look sensible, smooth

## child m  - finished, this is set as a chart that shows comparison between regions
    obviously can be used for shock value, it is an extreme fact of matter

## alcohol d - table of data related to countries where alcoholism is most rampant
    Can be used to express something related to cold weather, to a heart living where life is perpetually mysterious

### open def - related to the fact of extreme lack in hygiene, public madness
    To say that, the world contains places, lives where the things we take for granted are not so simple

## knowledge transmission HIV -
    This must be the same as with open defecation as the fact is that the data is too interspersed, and it would be similar to lying if I do not express when the most recent data was compiled
## life exp
    1. focus on Life expectancy at birth as what the data is based on. Though, again, the data is interspersed with years. But in this case, it is absolutely reasonable for the data to be based on the most recent year, and all others to be ignored, as this data has been regularly compiled

    2. use both sexes rather then male and female
## pop below poverty line
    Again, data is all over the place in terms of years, so the format I used prior is preferable
## violence
    small dataset best expressed as a bar chart, as it can all be visible instantly
## intimate partner
    1. this is region based and income based, so a different format is entirely reasonable, good chance to try something new

    2. I ought to focus on the large age group 15-69 but I must specify it is averaged between all ages in this sector
## s workers sylph
    1. again years are all over the place so the data has to be the format that I used previously or I must find a different way to represent it, get creative
    2. quite small dataset
## probability adult m
    This is a quite generalised dataset
    I ought to solely use both sexes
    global ought to be compared as a benchmark to all other regions


## First Poem
This one can be an ultra intense transmission. Not exactly fitting in general aspects but a means to express a hyper inflated view of life. Dramatic expression at its core. So…
